The purpose of this assignment was to find use vector math to find a common amino acid chain among proteins. We had to develop the program to insert the chain into each protein structure and had to write a way to ensure that each protein could be checked for a common distance and angle between links in the protein structure. 

To run:
$make 
./main.o
